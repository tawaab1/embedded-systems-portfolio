* There are no original extensions to: Circuit 2b - Digital Trumpet utilising code from SIK_Circuit_1c-digital_trumpet.

* The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-2c-simon-says-game-)
   
* Reflection: This exercise made me appreciate the implementation and the making of electrical games like Bop It! which follows a similar "Simon says" pattern. If I were to implement this into
my police car lights project it would probably to use the buttons to change the the light pattens.
