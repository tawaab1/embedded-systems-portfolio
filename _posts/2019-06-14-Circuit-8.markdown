* There are no original extensions to: Circuit 3a - Servo Motors

* utilising code from SIK_Circuit_1c-servo_motors. The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-3a-servo-motors)

* There were no needed changes that could have improved the experience of the buzzer circuit.

* Reflection: When building this part of the exercise I can see how I can implement this into building a robot which I can operate its motor 
functions physically through the use of the potentiometer.
