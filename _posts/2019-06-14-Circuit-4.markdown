* There are no original extensions to: Circuit 1d - RGB Night Light utilising code from SIK_Circuit_1c-rgb_night_light.

* The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-1d-rgb-night-light)
   
* The circuit was run under the presence of artificial light so I need to cover the photoresistor with my hand so to get the RGB light to work

* Reflection: Looking back on this exercise, this is something I can implement on my project where I want to build police car light that changes patterns rather than just having
one generic pattern of light.
