* There are no original extensions to: Circuit 2b - Digital Trumpet utilising code from SIK_Circuit_1c-digital_trumpet.

* The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-2b-digital-trumpet)
   
* Reflection: This exercise is an interesting experience and worth keeping note of if I am thinking of building a DIY electrical keyboard. This exercise could be useful to remember, if I am trying to implement this into my police car lights projects, where rather than switching sound patterns, I can switch different loops of light patterns.
