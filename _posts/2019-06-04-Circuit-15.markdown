* There were no significant changes that I made to : Circuit 5b - Remote-Controlled Robot

* utilising code from SIK_Circuit_4c-RemoteControlledRobot. The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-5b-remote-controlled-robot)

* Mistakes: Interestingly enough, I did not realise that the robots "face" was the wheels and the paper-clipper was its back, NOT the other way around. So I tried desperately to change the coding(changing the direction forward to -200, and backwards to 200) to fit my way of how I think the robot should be run. Even changing the motors around to make it go "forward".

* Reflection: Most circuits done so far have been using the power source of the laptop but now implementing its own power source is great because now I can create a robot that does not rely on an outside power source.
