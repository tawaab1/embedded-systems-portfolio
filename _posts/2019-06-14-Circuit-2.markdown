* There are no original extensions to: Circuit 1b -Potentiometer utilising codes from SIK_Circuit_1b-Potentiometer. The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-1b-potentiometer)
   
* There were issues which resulted in some troubleshooting from myself. I had forgotten to plug in two jumper wires (5v to 5v) and the (GND to GND(+)) which resulted in the LED not flickering consistently which was a problem when trying to take readings from the serial monitor.
   
* Differences between the source codes from this circuit from circuit 1a, is that circuit 1b delay is monitored by the potentiometer
  e.g delay(potposition); and the potposition (potentiometer position) is taken from the analog readings: analogRead(A0).
  
* When turning the dial, the delay is measured from 0 to 1023.
