* There are no original extensions to: Circuit 2a - Buzzer utilising code from SIK_Circuit_1c-buzzer. The source code was provided by https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-2a-buzzer
   
* Reflections: most problems that I encounted with building this circuit was forgeting to attach the appropriate jumper wires so when I tempered with the volume there was noticable changes to the volume
