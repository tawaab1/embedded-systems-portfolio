* There are a few changes that I made to the logical coding of: Circuit 3b - Distance Sensor

* utilising code from SIK_Circuit_1c-distance_sensor. The source code was provided by
  https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-3b-distance-sensor

* I had made change to the three if statements provide. if( distance <= 5){ turn the rgb red}; else if( distance >= 10 && distance <= 20){ turn the
  rgb light yellow}; else if(distance is more than 20){ turn the rgb light green}.
   
* Reflection: I did it this way because it looked more logical to me than the default coding provided
