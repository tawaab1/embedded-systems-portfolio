* There were no significant changes that I made to : Circuit 4c - DIY WHO AM I Game?

* utilising code from SIK_Circuit_4c-DIYWhoAmI. The source code was provided by [Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-4c-diy-who-am-i-game)

* No code changes implemented.

* Reflection: Most circuits done so far have been using the power source of the laptop but now implementing its own power source is great because now I can create a robot that does not rely on an outside power source.
